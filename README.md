This mod will not be developed or updated further, it relied on obscure edge case behaviour in immersive portals and supporting that would be putting an unfair burden on Quoteall.
# Universe Box
A mod that adds pocket dimensions for Minecraft 1.18.1 (Fabric)

## Features
Adds a new "Universe Box" block which, when placed, has a top that can be dropped into to enter a pocket dimension.
The "Universe Box" cannot be crafted, only found in dungeon, stronghold, and endcity chests.

Dependencies: 
* Immersive Portals (big thanks to qouteall for making an API for their mod, without it this mod would not be possible)
* Fabric API

# Universe Box
A mod that adds pocket dimensions for Minecraft 1.18.1 (Fabric)

The "Universe Box" cannot be crafted, only found in dungeon, stronghold, endcity chests.

Depends on Immersive Portals by qouteall
Depends on Fabric API
(big thanks to qouteall for making an API for their mod, without it this mod would be significantly less cool)
